Array:
------

1. It is a collection of similar data type
2. Elements of array are stored in continous memory locations
3. The first element of the array is available at index 0 and the last element of the array is available at the index N - 1 where N is total number of elements in the array
Note: [Java only] In java, an array has length property that contains the total number of elements in the array
array-name.length	//this will give you couting to elements in the array
4.Array itself is not a datatype, but a data structure.
5.Array is not Resizable.Once its size is declared it cannot be changed.

How to create an array in java:
-------------------------------
data-type array-name[] = new data-type[N];

::For example::
int marks[] = new int[5];	//array of int with 5 elements

you can initiaize the elements of array also such thst in case of initialization; new keyword is not required

data-type array-name[] = {comma separated values};
e.g.
double marks[] = {24.5, 25, 14, 29.0, 14.5};

Access the Elements of an Array:
--------------------------------
You can access an array element by referring to the index number.

This statement accesses the value of the first element in marks:

double marks[] = {24.5, 25, 14, 29.0, 14.5};
System.out.println(marks[0]);

Output:
24.5

Change an Array Element:
-----------------------
To change the value of a specific element, refer to the index number:

double marks[] = {24.5, 25, 14, 29.0, 14.5};
marks[0]=27;
System.out.println(marks[0]);

output:
27.0

Array Length:
------------
To find out how many elements an array has, use the length property:

double marks[] = {24.5, 25, 14, 29.0, 14.5};
System.out.println(marks.length);

Output:
5
